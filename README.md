## FAQS

2. **Is the payment upfront?** No, the payment isn't upfront. As soon as a client has given us information about themselves, the delivery duration countdown starts. When the client is completely satisfied with his/her result, only then will we accept a payment üòÅ. Please note that if the payment isn't delievered to us within 12 hours of completion, the portfolio services we provided to you will be **taken down/deleted**.

3. **When will Unifolio start it's operations?** From July 1st till August 1st. Requests for portfolio websites are only acknowledged if sent on Sundays or Wednesdays.
